 * `/Users/.../2026/August` or `C:\...\Some Folder\Final Folder`, so the user
 * still recognizes both the volume/root and the leaf they are exporting into.
 *
 * The path's own separator is preserved so it reads natively on each platform:
 * a Windows path (any `\` present) is rejoined with `\`, otherwise `/`. A
 * leading root separator is kept too, so an absolute POSIX path shows
 * `/Users/...` rather than losing its leading slash; Windows paths (`C:\...`)
 * have no leading separator and keep the volume (`C:`) as their root.
 *
 * The ellipsis lands only at separator boundaries, never inside a segment, so
 * the result is stable regardless of where a name happens to contain a space -
 * unlike CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis`, which WebKit renders with a stray gap
 * when the clip point falls on whitespace.
