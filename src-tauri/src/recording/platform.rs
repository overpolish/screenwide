//! Screen recording on macOS: ScreenCaptureKit into AVAssetWriter, hardware
//! H.264/HEVC encoding, no
//! intermediate files and no ffmpeg.
//!
//! # Who owns what
//!
//! `av::AssetWriter`, its input and the pixel buffer adaptor are not `Send`,
//! so they are created on, live on, and die on a single dedicated writer
//! thread that owns them for the whole recording. Nothing else ever touches
//! them. That thread's only input is one bounded channel.
//!
//! ScreenCaptureKit delivers frames on a dispatch queue. That callback does
//! the least work it possibly can - check the frame is a real one, retain its
//! pixel buffer, and hand it to the channel with `try_send`. It never blocks:
//! when the writer is behind, the channel is full and the frame is counted as
//! dropped rather than stalling the capture, which is what would make the
//! whole machine stutter.
//!
//! Pause, resume, stop and cancel travel down that same channel, so they are
//! ordered against the frames for free. There is no lock anywhere in the hot
//! path, and no state that two threads can see at once.
