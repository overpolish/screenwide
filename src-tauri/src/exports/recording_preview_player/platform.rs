//! Platform facade for preview decode, playback and thumbnails.
//!
//! [`super::super::preview_platform`] owns the *presentation* half of the
//! preview (the compositing surface below the webview) and carries the full
//! porting guide. This module owns the *production* half: getting pixels for a
//! given timestamp, at a given pane size, onto that surface.
//!
//! A backend must supply, with exactly these names and signatures:
//!
//! - [`VideoFramePayload`] - whatever a decoded playback frame is on this
//!   platform: the decoded GPU surfaces the compositor presents. Frames never
//!   cross IPC, so this is never encoded bytes.
//! - [`send_frame`] - hand one payload to the surface.
//! - [`spawn_video`] - the playback decode thread.
//! - [`StillDecoder`] and [`NATIVE_STILLS`] - the paused-frame and scrub path.
//!   A backend without one sets `NATIVE_STILLS` to `false`, and the player
//!   routes stills through [`spawn_video`] with `still = true` instead. The
//!   [`StillDecoder`] type must still exist and compile; it is simply never
//!   constructed.
//! - [`playback_factors`] - how far each pane's decode shrinks toward its
//!   on-screen size.
//! - [`generate_thumbnails`] and a `source_frame_jpeg` - the timeline strip
//!   and the one-off full-resolution frame the crop magnifier needs.
//!
//! Geometry, layout and settings math deliberately stay above this line, in
//! [`super::layout`] and the shared output validation, so a new backend never
//! reimplements them and never inherits Metal-specific assumptions.
