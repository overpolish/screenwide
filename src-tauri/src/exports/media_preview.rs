//! Audio prepared only for the export window.

//! The recording remains the source of truth. FFmpeg decodes a low-rate mono
//! signal from each track for a waveform. Playback itself stays native and
//! decodes the selected tracks on demand without writing preview derivatives.
//!
//! Each track was once also stream-copied into its own small M4A. Nothing ever
//! played them - the waveforms are decoded straight from the recording and the
//! window plays the mix - so they were an FFmpeg pass and a file per track for
//! no reader at all.
