//! Platform facade for the export window's live preview.
//!
//! # What this facade is
//!
//! The export window previews a recording or a screenshot by compositing frames
//! on the GPU into panes that sit *below* the OS webview. The webview draws only
//! UI chrome - on-screen controls, backdrop layers with CSS mask holes - so the
//! pixels the user is editing never cross IPC.
//!
//! Everything platform-specific about that lives behind this module and behind
//! [`super::recording_preview_player::platform`]. Shared Rust above the facade
//! owns geometry, layout and settings math (`recording_preview_player::layout`,
//! `media_preview::bake`, output validation) and must never assume a particular
//! GPU API.
//!
//! # Porting to a new platform
//!
//! A backend is a module that exports the same item names with the same
//! signatures as [`surface_macos`], selected by the `cfg` block below. Five
//! pieces make up a complete port, and a port has to be complete: the frontend
//! has no software preview to fall back to, so a backend that omits any of
//! them leaves that platform without a preview at all.
//!
//! 1. **A compositing surface created from a tauri window, rendering below the
//!    OS webview.** [`RecordingPreviewSurface::from_window`] takes the export
//!    [`WebviewWindow`] and attaches native panes as siblings *underneath* the
//!    webview's own view, so webview chrome composites on top of them. On
//!    macOS those are `CAMetalLayer`-backed views inserted below the
//!    `WKWebView` in the same `NSView` hierarchy (see
//!    `recording_preview_surface_macos.m`); on Windows the analogue is a
//!    DirectComposition visual tree, or a child HWND, ordered under the
//!    `WebView2` controller's HWND. The surface must provide batched pane
//!    layout ([`RecordingPreviewSurface::begin_layout`] / `layout` /
//!    `finish_layout`, so a resize is one atomic reposition and never tears
//!    against the webview), a viewport with an opaque backstop colour
//!    ([`RecordingPreviewSurface::set_viewport`] - the backstop is what shows
//!    through the webview's mask holes outside the panes),
//!    [`RecordingPreviewSurface::hide`], and the present-composed entry points
//!    below.
//! 2. **Present-composed-frame entry points.** `present` uploads a plain RGBA
//!    frame. [`RecordingPreviewSurface::present_composed`] takes a source image
//!    plus [`ScreenshotOutputSettings`] and does the whole output composition
//!    (background, rounding, shadow, cursor, camera overlay) on the GPU;
//!    `present_composed_pixels` is the zero-copy variant that takes an
//!    already-decoded platform pixel buffer so a playback frame never round
//!    trips through system memory. A backend that cannot do zero-copy yet may
//!    implement only `present_composed`.
//! 3. **A pane decoder and frame scrubber for stills and scrubbing**, plus (4)
//!    the **playback video path** - both live in
//!    [`super::recording_preview_player::platform`], which selects backends the
//!    same way this module does. The decoder answers "give me the frame at t,
//!    sized for this pane"; the scrubber keeps a warm long-lived decode context
//!    so dragging the timeline does not reopen a GOP per frame.
//! 5. **The export compositor** (writing the final file rather than the screen)
//!    is already split per platform in [`super::cursor_export`], under
//!    `platform_macos` / `platform_unsupported`.
//!
//! # Platform GPU backends
//!
//! macOS uses Metal and Windows uses D3D11 with DirectComposition. Another OS
//! can add its own backend behind this facade without leaking platform texture
//! formats, coordinate conventions, or window-surface details into shared
//! preview code.
